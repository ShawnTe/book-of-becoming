# book-of-becoming
A simple log to keep you on track with who you are becoming.

## The Basis 
We have a dream. We take action to bridge the epic gap between where we are now and that dream -- we start a business, decide to become a web developer, or something awesome. We're inspired! We jump in with wild abandon! We're fueled by the knowing that we Can Do This. We set the wheels in motion to bring this vision to reality.

## Problem
And then life happens. We hit obstacles, have bad days, feel dejected. Fears add layers of difficulty -- everything feels so hard. Questions become doubts become avoidance and thoughts of bailing out. 

Our human wiring is such 1 rotten apple will spoil a huge barrel of good apples. The memory of all progress and connections made goes totally blank when you're faced with a bad day. We get down on ourselves and continue the downward spiral that leads to inaction.

## Solution
What we need in these times of doubt and anxiety is to Remember how far we've come. By reclaiming our attention we consciously put our deterministic (?) self back in the drivers seat and halt the downward spiral into the murky pit of despair. By acknowledging what we Have done, we automatically invite a sliver of appreciation for our efforts. Those slivers of appreciation accumulate into gratitude -- the force of the Heart and will overcome all and reconnects you with the Vision that got you started in the first place. 

The Book of Becoming is a simple tool to help you remember and reconnect with your spark.
