## Summary
This was my passion project in Phase 2 of DevBootcamp. It's a CRUD app with MVC architecture and RESTful routes and is deployed on Heroku. I'm proud of the simple clean interface. 

Conceptually, it's in the crossroads of my past mindful productivity experience and new coding skills. Woohoo! 

## Tech stack
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Postgres DB
* Bcrypt & has_secure_password
